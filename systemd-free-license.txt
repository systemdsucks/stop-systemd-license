						SYSTEMD FREE LICENSE

The Systemd Free License is a mostly free license for software. This licence
amends software licences and is supposed to be used in conjunction with any.
It adds one simple restriction aimed at sparing users the functional abuse(s)
of systemd while also saving the Free Software world from its cancerous nature.

The infamous systemd project is designed to take away init freedom and 
establish a dangerous monoculture by unjustifiably encroaching upon every piece 
of software it encounters. The Stop Systemd License is designed to put an end 
to this by explicitly forbidding any dependency, integration etc... with it.
To clarify: SFL-licensed software should work under systemd as init till the 
point where integration, dependency etc... are required. The developer is 
allowed to implement workarounds to that effect. It is also explicitly 
forbidden to actively implement any mechanism to unjustifiably degrade the 
certified software's functionality when running under systemd as init, e.g. 
simply refusing to run with no good reason.

Quoting the GNU GPL version 3: 
«To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these 
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain 
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.» The Stop Systemd License 
simply asks you to focus this common courtesy on the choice of init system. 
Don't add systemd dependencies. Don't use any of its libraries or
functionalities. Don't fall for it. Don't become part of the problem.

Any derivative work can only be distributed under the terms of this license.

STAY UNIX. STAY PORTABLE.
